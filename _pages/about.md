I am Ankur Sharma and am currently a 5th-year student of Bachelor & Master of Technology in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. My primary research interests lie in deploying the techniques of AI in the real-world to create a positive societal impact by helping people and tackling humanitarian and environmental challenges. This entails the need for developing a platform for cross-domain research that spans several related areas in cognition, perception, language, and vision. I aim to devise novel methods to extend these ideas in complex interspersed settings that arise in Health Care, Security, IoT and other Natural Sciences.
