I am Ankur Sharma, currently a research intern in the Social Media Analysis team (under [Joyojeet Pal](http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/)) of Technology for Emerging Markets group at \textbf{Microsoft Research (MSR)}, Bangalore. I have graduated with a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) and Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Computer Science from \textbf{Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.} My primary research interests lie in understanding these complex human social networks, with focus on the use of new and traditional media technologies that affect our day to day lives. I wish to deploy my skills in data science with state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to curate and archive content, categorize it in suitable typologies and identify significant trends in the data using statistical modelling. I wish to pursue interdisciplinary research in computational social science so as to create a positive societal impact in the real world by helping people in tackling various humanitarian challenges. My recent research projects have been centred around the use of social media platforms in mainstream politics, specifically around political brand building in India. My long-term career plan is to be a researcher in applied machine learning â€“ either in industry or in academia. Applied Machine Learning entails the need for cross-domain research on large real-world datasets that span several related areas in natural language, vision and media studies, amongst others.
