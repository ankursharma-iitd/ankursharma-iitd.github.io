# State-By-State Analysis

This is work dony by Ankur Sharma, Saloni Dash, Himani Negi and Joyojeet Pal at Microsoft Research (MSR) India. Here, we give an example for one of states (Bihar) amongst the set of 20 states that we consider in our main piece.

## Bihar on Social Media
We summarize the key trends with Twitter use among politicians in Bihar.

### Language
We see that for all the parties, tweeting in Hindi gets significantly more retweets than when they tweet in English. The size of the colored bubbles in the scatter plot is proportionate to the share of politicians whose majority tweets (over 50% in any single language) are in either Hindi or English. We see for instance that in all four parties, more politicians use Hindi as their primary language for tweeting than English. We also see that for some parties â€“ RJD and BJP get retweeted much higher when in Hindi than in English.
