This is done as part of the course assignment for COL-864 (Robotics Vision) under Prof. Rohan Paul. Assignment Statement is given [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ra497raqmd7ed8d/Homework-I.pdf?dl=0).

## State Space
Here, the state space refers to all the possible valid positions in the 2D Grid (5x5) where the agent can possibly be. Each position is a tuple of the form (i, j) representing the ith row and the jth column of the board. This is also made clear from the diagram above. We will use Xt to unique denote the position of the agent (i.e. the state) at the time 't'. The set of all possible states is denoted by the symbol S. Hence, the entire state space consists of M2 states where M is the grid size. Hence, in this part, there are 25 states.

S = {(i, j): 0 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 4, 0 ‚â§ j ‚â§ 4; i, j ùûä N}
