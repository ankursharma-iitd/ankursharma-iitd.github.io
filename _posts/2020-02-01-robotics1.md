This is done as part of the course assignment for COL-864 (Robotics Vision) under Prof. Rohan Paul. Assignment Statement is given [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ra497raqmd7ed8d/Homework-I.pdf?dl=0).

## State Space
Here, the state space refers to all the possible valid positions in the 2D Grid (5x5) where the agent can possibly be. Each position is a tuple of the form (i, j) representing the ith row and the jth column of the board. This is also made clear from the diagram above. We will use Xt to unique denote the position of the agent (i.e. the state) at the time 't'. The set of all possible states is denoted by the symbol S. Hence, the entire state space consists of M2 states where M is the grid size. Hence, in this part, there are 25 states.

S = {(i, j): 0 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 4, 0 ‚â§ j ‚â§ 4; i, j ùûä N}

## Observation Space
Since the position of the agent is not visible from the surface of the lake, we use sensors that emit two sounds coming from the Rotor and Bump. Each sound detected by the sensor is a boolean variable indicating the presence or absence of the sound. Hence, the entire observation space is a tuple of 2 boolean variables Bt and Rt. Hence, it consists of four different observations at each time step. The set O completely describes the observation space. We will assume that the state sequence starts at t = 0; for various uninteresting reasons, we will assume that evidence starts arriving at t = 1 rather than t = 0. 

B = {"bump", "no bump"}
R = {"rotor", "no rotor"}
O = {(Bi, Rj): Bi ùûä {"bump", "no bump"},  Rj ùûä {"rotor", "no rotor"}}

We will use Bt and Rt to denote the observation taken from the sensor at some time 't'.

## Action Space
It refers to the space of all possible actions taken at each state. As given in the question, the agent is likely to take all the four possible sections {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT} with an equal probability. If the agent is at a corner position, some of the actions won't be feasible in that state, but the agent won't know about it before execution. As a result, the agent won't change its state, but the action will still be sampled from the same uniform distribution. At will denote the action taken by the agent at a time 't'.

A = {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT} 

## Transition Model
It refers to modeling the distribution of P(Xt|Xt-1) where Xt denotes the state of the agent at the time 't'. Fig 1 below denotes all possible transitions and completely describes the transition model.

## Observation Model
The probabilities P(Rt | Xt) and P(Bt | Xt) have been shown below respectively. Dark regions denote 0.1 probability while the light regions denote 0.9 probability.
