## Purpose
The purpose of this android application is to provide an easy and user friendly way to keep track of your expenses/food calories/important notes at one place. This application is motivated by the fact that you have to use different applications for each of these use cases. Sometimes, these use cases are inter-dependent, for example, you might want to note down certain items to buy depending upon your current expenses. We also provide category wise tags to organize the items in the app for easy access.

Our project aims to create a standalone platform for self management through which one can manage all their notes, memos, expenses, food intake / calories using just one application.

## Scope
Scope of this project is building a complete standalone android application which will have different function- alities, all specific to different self-management tasks. In this project we will build the following:

* **Authentication module:** User login and Signup is handled by this module.
* **Calories module:** Manage the fitness section of the user datewise with customized tags.
* **Expenses module:** Manages the expenses section of the user on various items of manually entered cateegories.
* **Notes module:** Keeps track of personalised notes of the user in different scenarios.
* **Tagging module:** Creates and manages custom tags for notes, expenses, food items, etc.
* **Filtering module:** Allows the user to filter expenses, calories, etc. between a user-selected start and end date

## Functionalities
ManageMe is supposed to be a simple self management app. It has the following main functionalities:

* **Expense Management:** A user can manage all the daily expenses by keeping track of each expenses with specific tags. We also provide a filter function through which reports can be generated for any date range selected by the user.
* **Notes:** A user can add to-do lists, simple notes with specific tags. Tag wise search would ensure all the items under a particular tag can be viewed.
* **Calories Record:** One can maintain a record of daily food intake by adding food items and their associated calories already present in our large database. It can be used for weekly / monthly analysis of total calories consumed.
